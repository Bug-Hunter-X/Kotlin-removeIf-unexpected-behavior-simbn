This repository demonstrates an uncommon bug related to the `removeIf` function in Kotlin when used with different collection types (List, Set, Map).  The `removeIf` function behaves differently based on the type of collection it's applied to, which may lead to unexpected outcomes if not carefully considered.  The bug.kt file shows the problem, and bugSolution.kt offers a solution to handle this potential issue in a more robust way.
